## Problem statement
Students have problems nowadays with maintaining consistent study habits, organizing learning tasks, and tracking their academic progress. Increasing workload, several subjects, and lack of structured planning make many learners fail to manage time effectively. For that reason, incomplete tasks result in poor productivity, low confidence, and inconsistent academic performances.

Traditional manual methods, such as paper timetables or just simple to-do lists, are unable to adapt to changing workloads during the student year, provide no analytics, nor give personalized recommendations based on study patterns.

This calls for the development of an intelligent, automated, and user-friendly system that guides students in planning studies, monitoring progress, analyzing productivity, and receiving recommendations based on big data to enhance learning efficiency.

The Smart Education Assistant solves this problem through an intelligent digital study planner by automating task management, monitoring performance, and offering personalized suggestions that help students learn more effectively and maintain consistency.
